### Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
**Objective:**  
Understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a dataset using the Iris Dataset.

**Approach:**
- Loaded data using `pandas`.
- Displayed dataset structure with `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.head()`.
- Created:
  - Scatter plots (pairwise relationships)
  - Histograms (data distribution)
  - Box plots (outliers)

**Skills Used:**  
Data inspection, basic summarization, plotting with `matplotlib` & `seaborn`

### Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction
**Objective:**  
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan.

**Approach:**
- Cleaned dataset and handled missing values
- Performed EDA on key features: `loan_amount`, `education`, `income`
- Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
- Evaluated with accuracy and confusion matrix

**Skills Used:**  
Data cleaning, binary classification, performance evaluation

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
**Objective:**  
Identify customers likely to leave the bank using the Churn Modelling Dataset.

**Approach:**
- Cleaned and encoded categorical data (Geography, Gender)

- Analyzed feature importance to understand what influences churn

**Skills Used:**  
Categorical encoding, supervised classification, insight extraction

---

### Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts
**Objective:**  
Estimate medical insurance charges based on personal features.

**Approach:**
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Visualized relationships between BMI, age, smoking and charges
- Evaluated model with MAE and RMSE

**Skills Used:**  
Regression modeling, visualization, error analysis

---

### Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction
**Objective:**  
Predict which customers are more likely to accept a personal loan offer.

**Approach:**
- Explored features like `age`, `job`, and `marital status`
- Trained Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers
- Analyzed results to identify customer groups most likely to accept the offer

**Skills Used:**  
EDA, classification modeling, business insight generation
